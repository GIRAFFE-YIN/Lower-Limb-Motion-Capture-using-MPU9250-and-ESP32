# Lower-Limb-Motion-Capture-using-MPU9250-and-ESP32
This work presents a human lower limb movement capture system to analyze the kinematics of human walking from inertial sensors. The system using 7 MPU9250 and 7 ESP32 to build a wireless and portable tools which allows to measure the gait without altering its natural patterns.
